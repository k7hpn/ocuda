# Ops.Web/js

This folder contains vendor JavaScript files which are updated with the top level `dev/docker-yarn-update.sh` script. When that script is run, the contents of this directory are erased.

If you want to add project-specific JavaScript files please add them in the `Ops.Web/Scripts` folder and ensure they are minified in `Startup.cs`.
